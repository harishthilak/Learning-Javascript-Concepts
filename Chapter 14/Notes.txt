Higher-Order Functions (HoFs) â€” Simplified

Definition:
A higher-order function is a function that either:
Takes another function as a parameter, or
Returns a function.

Why Use Higher-Order Functions?
Abstraction: Hides repetitive logic (like loops) and lets us focus on the task, not the mechanics.
Clean code: Shorter, more readable, and maintainable.
Reusability: Write functions that can be reused with different behaviors.

Use .map() when transforming each item in an array.
Use .filter() when selecting specific items.
Use .reduce() when combining values into one.
