 Regular (ES5): Defined using function keyword.
  - Can be called or used as an object constructor with new.
  - Inside, the this keyword refers to:The execution context (e.g. window) in normal calls, or The new object instance when used with new.
 Arrow Functions (ES6+): Defined as () => {}.
  - Cannot be used as constructors (cannot use new).
  - Lexically bind this (inherits from the surrounding scope).
  - No arguments objectâ€”so use rest ...args if needed.
